You can optionally provide an [invite link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Custom-Invite-Link) for people to join your Discord server. You can create an invite link for your Discord server by following the steps in [Discord's documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Custom-Invite-Link).

Once created you can set your Discord invite link in Hall by navigating to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Discord invite link** section.

When set, this link will be displayed in various contexts within Hall to encourage and promote people to join the conversation from within the Discord client.
