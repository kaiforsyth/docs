## Robots.txt

A `robots.txt` file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on a website.

We automatically generate a `robots.txt` file for every Hall community site. Your site's file can be accessed from the `/robots.txt` path, for example it can be viewed by navigating to `yourcommunity.hall.community/robots.txt` and replacing the URL with your site's domain.
