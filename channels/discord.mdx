The Discord channel integration in Hall works by syncing conversation threads from specific Discord channels into your Hall community site.

## Syncing Discord channels

Hall supports syncing from [Discord Forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) and [Discord Text channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels).

To sync channels from Discord, navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Synced Discord channels** section.
3. Click **Add a channel**.
4. Select the Forum or Text channels you wish to sync.

### Discord Forum channels

[Discord Forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) are self-contained threads that enable the discussion of topics.

As all replies to a message in a Forum channel as self-contained, any replies will be automatically synced as a post in Hall.

- The **post title**, **post content**, and any **attachments** are synced with Hall.
- **Tags** and **Reactions** are currently not synced.
- Posts deleted in Discord are automatically deleted in Hall.

### Discord Text channels

[Discord Text channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels) are general chat message channels.

Hall will not sync a message sent in a text channel unless it has been created into a **thread**. This ensures that all relevant replies made in a thread can be synced as replies in Hall.

- The **thread title**, **post content**, and any **attachments** are synced with Hall.
- **Reactions** are currently not synced.
- Deleted messages in Discord are automatically deleted in Hall.
