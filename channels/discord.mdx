## Syncing Discord channels

The Discord channel integration in Hall works by syncing conversation threads from specific Discord channels into your Hall community site. [See how to configure syncing](syncing) to bring Discord messages into Hall.

Hall supports syncing from:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Forum channels" href="syncing#discord-text-channels">
    Sync posts that have been created in a forum channel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text channels" href="syncing#discord-text-channels">
    Sync any Discord text messages that have been created into threads.
  </Card>
  
</CardGroup>

## Discord invite link

You can optionally provide an [invite link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Custom-Invite-Link) for people to join your Discord server. You can create an invite link for your Discord server by following the steps in [Discord's documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Custom-Invite-Link).

Once created you can set your Discord invite link in Hall by navigating to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Discord invite link** section.

When set, this link will be displayed in various contexts within Hall to encourage and promote people to join the conversation from within the Discord client.

## Importing all Discord messages

By default, Hall will only sync messages from Discord that have been sent after the Hall app is installed on your Discord server.

You can manually sync messages created before this by navigating to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Import all Discord messages** section.
3. Click **Import all Discord messages**.

This action is a bulk operation that will be performed in the background and may take several minutes to be completed. Very old archived posts that cannot be accessed via Discord's API will not be imported.
