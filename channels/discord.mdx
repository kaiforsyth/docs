The Discord channel integration in Hall works by syncing conversation threads from specific Discord channels into your Hall community site.

## Syncing Discord channels

Hall supports syncing from [Discord Forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) and [Discord Text channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels).

To sync channels from Discord, navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Synced Discord channels** section.
3. Click **Add a channel**.
4. Select the Forum or Text channels you wish to sync.

### Discord Forum channels

[Discord Forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) are self-contained threads that enable the discussion of topics.

As all replies to a message in a Forum channel as self-contained, any replies will be automatically synced as a post in Hall.

- The **post title**, **post content**, and any **attachments** are synced with Hall.
- **Tags** and **Reactions** are currently not synced.
- Posts deleted in Discord are automatically deleted in Hall.

### Discord Text channels

[Discord Text channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels) are general chat message channels.

Hall will not sync a message sent in a text channel unless it has been created into a **thread**. This ensures that all relevant replies made in a thread can be synced as replies in Hall.

- The **thread title**, **post content**, and any **attachments** are synced with Hall.
- **Reactions** are currently not synced.
- Deleted messages in Discord are automatically deleted in Hall.

### Automatic message syncing

You can choose to enable or disable automatic syncing of messages with Hall. By default, all threads and forum channel messages will be synced with Hall.

To change this setting, navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Automatic message syncing** section.

If you disable syncing, messages will have to be manually pushed to Hall.

[Discord admins](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5309276245271-Discord-Admin-FAQ) are able to manually push messages to Hall by:
1. Clicking the **••• More** action for the message you wish to push.
2. Selecting the **Apps** menu.
3. Choosing the **Push to community site** action from the Hall Discord app.

If you do not see this action or see _No Commands Available_, check whether you have the right [Discord admin permissions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ) to interact with the Hall app.

## Discord invite link

You can optionally provide an [invite link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Custom-Invite-Link) for people to join your Discord server. You can create an invite link for your Discord server by following the steps in [Discord's documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Custom-Invite-Link).

Once created you can set your Discord invite link in Hall by navigating to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Discord invite link** section.

When set, this link will be displayed in various contexts within Hall to encourage and promote people to join the conversation from within the Discord client.

## Importing all Discord messages

By default, Hall will only sync messages from Discord that have been sent after the Hall app is installed on your Discord server.

You can manually sync messages created before this by navigating to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Import all Discord messages** section.
3. Click **Import all Discord messages**.

This action is a bulk operation that will be performed in the background and may take several minutes to be completed. Very old archived posts that cannot be accessed via Discord's API will not be imported.
