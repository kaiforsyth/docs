Hall supports syncing from [Discord Forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) and [Discord Text channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels).

To sync channels from Discord, navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Synced Discord channels** section.
3. Click **Add a channel**.
4. Select the Forum or Text channels you wish to sync.

## Discord Forum channels

[Discord Forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) are self-contained threads that enable the discussion of topics.

As all replies to a message in a Forum channel as self-contained, any replies will be automatically synced as a post in Hall.

- The **post title**, **post content**, and any **attachments** are synced with Hall.
- **Tags** and **Reactions** are currently not synced.
- Posts deleted in Discord are automatically deleted in Hall.

## Discord Text channels

[Discord Text channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels) are general chat message channels.

Hall will not sync a message sent in a text channel unless it has been created into a **thread**. This ensures that all relevant replies made in a thread can be synced as replies in Hall.

- The **thread title**, **post content**, and any **attachments** are synced with Hall.
- **Reactions** are currently not synced.
- Deleted messages in Discord are automatically deleted in Hall.

## Automatic message syncing

You can choose to enable or disable automatic syncing of messages with Hall. By default, all threads and forum channel messages will be synced with Hall.

To change this setting, navigate to [**Channels** in the admin dashboard](https://dashboard.usehall.com/channels), then select:
1. **Manage** for Discord.
2. Go to the **Automatic message syncing** section.

If you disable syncing, messages will have to be manually pushed to Hall.

[Discord admins](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5309276245271-Discord-Admin-FAQ) are able to manually push messages to Hall by:
1. Clicking the **••• More** action for the message you wish to push.
2. Selecting the **Apps** menu.
3. Choosing the **Push to community site** action from the Hall Discord app.

If you do not see this action or see _No Commands Available_, check whether you have the right [Discord admin permissions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ) to interact with the Hall app.
