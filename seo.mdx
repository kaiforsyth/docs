## Sitemap generation

We automatically generate an XML sitemap for every community site. This helps search engine crawlers discover and index all of the content and pages on your Hall community site.

It tells search engines like Google when a page was last modified (`<lastmod>`) and how frequently it should check back for updates (`<changefreq>`). You can see the typical shape of a sitemap below:

````
<url>
<loc>https://example.hall.community/how-do-i-change-my-password-qNrvDJFMPCWg</loc>
<lastmod>2024-09-16T06:15:53.703Z</lastmod>
<changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
</url>
````

Your site’s sitemap can be accessed from the `/sitemap.xml` path. For example, it can be viewed by navigating to `example.hall.community/sitemap.xml` and replacing that URL with your site’s domain.

You can learn more about sitemap's in [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap).

### Submitting sitemap to Google

When Google's search crawler next visits your Hall site, it will automatically fetch your sitemap from your [robots.txt](#robots-txt-file).

You can also manually submit your sitemap to Google through the [Google Search Console](#using-google-search-console).

After adding your community site as a new property in [Google Search Console](#using-google-search-console), you can submit your sitemap by navigating to the **Sitemaps report**.

Simply add copy your sitemap's URL, `example.hall.community/sitemap.xml` for example, and then click **Add**.

This will enable you to see when your sitemap was last read by Google, how many pages have been discovered, and if there are any errors with your sitemap.

## Structured data

Every Hall community site automatically supports special structured data formats that enables Google to display pages as enriched search results.

Specifically, Hall currently supports the `DiscussionForumPosting` and `QAPage` structured data schemas documented by Google.

## Q&A pages

Q&A pages (`QAPage`) are web pages that contain data in a question and answer format, which is one question followed by its answers.

Pages with the Q&A structured data are eligible to have a rich result displayed on the search results page. This rich treatment helps your site reach the right users in search results.

For example, you might see a rich result for the user query "How do I change my password?" if the page has been marked up with answers to that question.

In addition to enabling your content for the rich result treatment, marking up your Q&A page helps Google generate a better snippet for your page.

You can read more about Q&A pages in [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/qapage).


## Using Google Search Console

## Robots.txt file

A `robots.txt` file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on a website. It also helps search engines to discover the [sitemap](#sitemap-generation) for a website. This file is automatically generated for every Hall community site.

Your site’s file can be accessed from the `/robots.txt` path. For example, it can be viewed by navigating to `example.hall.community/robots.txt` and replacing that URL with your site’s domain.
